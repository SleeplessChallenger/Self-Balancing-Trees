<h2>Self-balancing trees</h2>

- As you may know, there are various types of trees within Data Structures and
  Algorithms:
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Self-balancing Trees
  - Heaps
  - Trie

- The above list isn't finite and may be prolonged. But I decided to focus
  on self-balancing trees as they seem pretty juicy.

<h3>Structure of the repo</h3>

- For now there is `AVL trees` folder where you can find my notes<br>
  and Python\Kotlin implementations.
